### This repository contains my work during my virtual internship at ANZ

### About the project-
  This dataset is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 monthsâ€™ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions. Exploratory data analysis is carried out to understand the data and then using the same transaction dataset, i have predicted the monthly salary for each customer

### files-

exploratory data analysis- ANZ_EDA.ipynb
salary_prediction- ANZ_prediction.ipynb

### models used- Linear Regression Model, Decition Tree Regressor.

### conclusion- due to the limited 100 customer details could achieve R-squared accuracy of just 0.30
